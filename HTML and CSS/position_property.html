        <p>First, “something went wrong” is vague and not helpful. When something
            different from what I expected happens, I already have a feeling that
            something is not right. Seeing the same on screen is not very helpful.
            At least let me know how I can contact whom and what I should tell them
            to help figure out what’s going on.I don’t need all the details of
            what’s up - pushing a full stack trace in the face of your customer
            is not the way either.A good while ago, I was in the same situation.
            The message was still the ‘something went wrong’ (couldn’t be more
            creative at the time), but we also included an error code, so customer
            care knew what to say / do. (I recall some people are still traumatized
            by a certain “error 62”). Then, someone suggested, “ah, error codes are
            too technical, let’s get rid of them as they confuse customers”.
            You know, customer experience is very important. Sure - and bam, no
            one knew what was happening any more.First, “something went wrong” is

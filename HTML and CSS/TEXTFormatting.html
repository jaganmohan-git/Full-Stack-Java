            <p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </strong>  
            <b>15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015</b> was an 
            <b><u>Indian aerospace scientist and statesman</u></b> who served as the 
            <b><i>president of India from 2002 to 2007.</i></b> Born and raised in a Muslim family in 
            <mark>Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu,</mark> Kalam studied 
            <mark>physics and aerospace engineering.</mark></p>

            <p style="font-size: medium;">He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence 
            <u>Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</u> and was 
            intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. 
            He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch 
            vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in the Pokhran-II 
            nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974.</p>

            <p>Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party 
            and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's President". 
            He engaged in teaching, writing, and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards, 
            including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, Kalam 
            collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands attended the funeral 
            ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours. A memorial was 
            inaugurated near his home town in 2017.</p>

            <h2 style="font-style: calc();"><u>Career as a scientist</u></h2>
            <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence 
                Research & Development Service and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and 
                Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. During his early career, he was involved in the design of small 
                hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[20] Later, he joined the Indian National 
                Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai.[3] He was interviewed and 
                recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of the Thumba 
                Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.
                In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV)
                which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980. He had earlier started work on an 
                expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[22] In 1969, Kalam received the approval from the Government 
                of India to expand the programme to include more engineers.[19] In 1963–64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center 
                in Hampton, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, and Wallops Flight Facility.[2][23] Since the late 1970s, Kalam was
                part of the effort to develop the SLV-3 and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), both of which were successful.</p>
